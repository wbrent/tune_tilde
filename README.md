# tune_tilde

[tune~] is a Pure Data vanilla abstraction that performs polyphonic real-time tuning of a live input signal to any desired MIDI pitch while keeping the spectral envelope relatively intact. It uses an adaptation of the technique demonstrated in Pd's I10.phase.bash.pd documentation patch.

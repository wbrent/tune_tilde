# tune_tilde

[tune~] is a Pure Data object that tunes an input signal to any desired MIDI pitch while keeping formant structure relatively intact. It is an adaptation of the built-in Pure Data documentation patch I10.phase.bash.pd. While the original patch has separate analysis and playback stages, [tune~] is designed for real-time pitch correction.
